# Roblox-Launcher-minus-the-app

A custom-made Roblox Launcher. Why would I keep patching Roblox's abhorrent launcher, when I can build my own!

# Manual Instructions

1. Open File Explorer and go to your roblox directory ``%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Roblox/Versions``

2. Look for the version folder that contains `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe`

3. Delete your current `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe` and replace it with the custom one;
