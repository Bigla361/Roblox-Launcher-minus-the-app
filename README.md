# Roblox-Launcher-minus-the-app

Literally just RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe, but it won't launch games to the Roblox App.

# Instructions

1. Open File Explorer and go to your roblox directory ``%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Roblox/Versions``

2. Look for the version folder that contains `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe`

3. Delete your current `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe` and replace it with the patched one;
